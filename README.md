# WAweatherbot

This is a twitter bot that interacts with the Weather Underground API (https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/) to gather and tweet the weather report for various locations from around Washington State.

The bot determines which locations to tweet about based on a series of randomly generated numbers, and makes sure not to tweet about the same location twice.
