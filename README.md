# WAweatherbot

This is a twitter bot that interacts with the Weather Underground API (https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/) to gather and tweet the weather report for various locations from around Washington State.

It currently tweets only for Seattle, but will be expanded to cycle through different locations.
